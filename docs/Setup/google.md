## 🔧 Google App Setup Guide

To use Google OAuth2 in your Django REST Framework app, you need to set up a Google App. Here's a step-by-step guide to obtain the necessary credentials (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri`) and configure your app.

### Step 1: Create a Google Developer Account
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Log in with your Google account or create one if you don't have it.

### Step 2: Create a Google Project
1. Click on **Select project**
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.

### Step 3: Create Google App
1. Click on the navigation menu in the top right corner.
2. Select **APIs & Services**.
3. Go to **Oauth consent screen** section.
4. Click on **CREATE**.
5. Fill in the required information and click on **SAVE AND CONTINUE** several times until the application is created.

### Step 4: Create Credentials
1. Go to the **Credentials** section.
2. Click on **CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **OAuth client ID**.
3. Select the application type **Web Application** and fill in the required fields.
4. Add your `redirect_uri` under **Authorized redirect URIs**. This should match the redirect URL used in your code, e.g., `http://localhost:8000/google/callback`.
5. After you have filled in the required fields, click **CREATE**.
6. After you have created it, you should open a window with your Client ID and Client secret. Make sure to store these securely.

### Step 5: OAuth 2.0 Configuration
1. Go to [Google Developer](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).
2. Click on **OAuth 2.0 Configuration** (gear in the upper right corner).
3. Check the box for **Use your own OAuth credentials**.
4. In the **OAuth Client ID:** field, enter your (`client_id`). In the **OAuth Client Secret:** field, enter the (`client_secret`) and click **Close**

### Step 6: Store Credentials Securely
Add the following to your `.env` file:
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/google/callback/
```
Use the `dotenv` package to load these variables in your Django project.



## 🚀 Getting Started

First, import the needed 📦 class and set up your Google App ⚙️ settings:

```python
from omni_authify.providers import Google

# Set up Google App settings (found in your Google Cloud App's dashboard)
google_provider = Google(
    client_id='🔑 your-google-client-id', 
    client_secret='🔒 your-google-client-secret',
    redirect_uri='🌐 your-google-redirect-uri',
    scope='openid email profile' #optional
)
```

> **⚠️ Note:** It's best to store your Google App settings in a `.env` file for 🔐 security. You can access them in `settings.py` using `python-dotenv` or `environ`.

**Example `.env` file:**
```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=🔑 your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=🔒 your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/google/callback/
```

## ⚙️ Updating Settings

Make sure that your `redirect_uri` matches the callback URL you set in your Google app settings and in your Django URLs.

## 📋 Methods

### 1. 🔗 Get Authorization URL
This method creates the link 🔗 you need to send the user to so they can log in using Google.

```python
def get_authorization_url(state=None):
    pass
```

**Parameters:**
- `state` (str, optional): A random string 🔀 to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Returns:**
- `str`: The URL 🌐 to use for Google login.

**Example:**
```python
auth_url = google_provider.get_authorization_url(state='random_state_string')
```

### 2. 📄 Get User Profile
This method gets the user's profile information from Google.

```python
def get_user_profile(access_token):
    pass
```


**Parameters:**
- `access_token` (str): The access token 🔑 you got from `request.GET`.

**Returns:**
- `dict`: The user's profile information 📋.

**Example:**
```python
user_info = google_provider.get_user_profile(access_token)
```

---

## 🛠️ Customizing Fields

You can choose which fields you want to get from the user's profile by changing the `scope` parameter.

Without changing it, you will receive an openid, profile and email address (everything that can be taken).

**Example:**
```python
fields = "openid email profile"
user_info = google_provider.get_authorization_url(scope=scope)
```

## ✅ Best Practices
- **🔒 Use Environment Variables:** Always use environment variables to store important information like `client_id` and `client_secret`. This helps keep your credentials safe 🛡️.
- **🔗 Match Redirect URI:** Make sure the `redirect_uri` is the same in both your Google App settings and your code to avoid errors 🚫 during the login process.
- **⚠️ Error Handling:** Handle any possible errors 🐞 during the login and token exchange process to ensure a smooth user experience 😊.

Now you're ready to use Google for authenticating users in your app 🚀. Follow these steps and best practices to make sure everything runs securely 🔐 and smoothly ✨.
